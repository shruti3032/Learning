+ 2. Mobile Optimization
Mobile optimization is about improving website performance and usability on mobile devices. This includes lazy loading, AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages), and optimizing the viewport settings to guarantee quick loading times and easy navigation on smartphones and tablets.
+ 3. Performance Optimization
Performance optimization is aimed at reducing page load time while improving website speed. The minification, compression, caching, and CDN (Content Delivery Network) integration are some of the ways of resource delivery optimization that lead to improved overall performance.
+ 4. SEO-Friendly Practices:
SEO-friendly practices would mean activities that make your website easy to find by search engines while increasing its visibility in SERPs. Optimizing meta ta
+ 5. Accessibility Compliance
